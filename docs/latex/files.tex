\item\contentsline{section}{include/\hyperlink{ada__pmmh_8h}{ada\+\_\+pmmh.\+h} \\*Performs an adaptive version of the particle marginal Metropilis-\/\+Hastings algorithm. The user is asked to design his/her own proposal density and prior distribution. The sampling is handled on an \char`\"{}as-\/is\char`\"{} basis, which means that it is entirely the user\textquotesingle{}s own responsibility to decide on what parameterization to use, to handle Jacobians if they are necessary, etc. These parameters will be written in an \char`\"{}as-\/is\char`\"{} fashion, as well. These calculations can be facilitates using the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classparamPack}{param\+Pack}} class, however using this class is not absolutely necessary. Also, for convenience, a moving average covariance matrix estimate is performed; however, this should be ignored if the user is not interested in adaptive M\+C\+MC or isn\textquotesingle{}t using a transformed parameter space }{\pageref{ada__pmmh_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\hyperlink{ada__pmmh__mvn_8h}{ada\+\_\+pmmh\+\_\+mvn.\+h} \\*Performs adaptive particle marginal metropolis-\/hastings sampling, using a multivariate normal distribution as the proposal. This samples on the transformed space, but it writes out the untransformed/constrained samples to the output. The priors requested by the user are for the (hopefully more convenient) un-\/transformed or constrained space. This means that the user never has to worry about handling any kind of Jacobian--just specify a prior on the familiar space, and a function that approximates log-\/likelihoods }{\pageref{ada__pmmh__mvn_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\hyperlink{ada__rwmh_8h}{ada\+\_\+rwmh.\+h} \\*Performs adaptive random walk metropolis-\/hastings sampling (uses a multivariate normal distribution as the proposal). This samples on the transformed space, but it writes the untransformed/constrained samples to the output. The priors requested by the user are for the (more convenient) un-\/transformed aka constrained space. This means that the user never has to worry about handling any kind of Jacobian }{\pageref{ada__rwmh_8h}}{}
