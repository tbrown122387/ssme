Performs adaptive random walk metropolis-\/hastings sampling (uses a multivariate normal distribution as the proposal). This samples on the transformed space, but it writes the untransformed/constrained samples to the output. The priors requested by the user are for the (more convenient) un-\/transformed aka constrained space. This means that the user never has to worry about handling any kind of Jacobian.
