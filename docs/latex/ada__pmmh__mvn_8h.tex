Performs adaptive particle marginal metropolis-\/hastings sampling, using a multivariate normal distribution as the proposal. This samples on the transformed space, but it writes the the untransformed/constrained samples to the output. The priors requested by the user are for the (hopefully more convenient) un-\/transformed or constrainedspace. This means that the user never has to worry about handling any kind of Jacobian.
