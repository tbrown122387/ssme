Performs (possibly-\/adaptive) particle marginal Metropolis-\/\+Hastings sampling, using a multivariate normal distribution as the parameter proposal. This samples on the transformed space, but it writes out the untransformed/constrained samples to the output. The ~\newline
 priors requested by the user are for the (hopefully more convenient) un-\/transformed or constrained space. This means that the user never has to worry about handling any kind of Jacobian--just specify a prior on the familiar space, and a function that approximates log-\/likelihoods.
