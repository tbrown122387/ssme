Performs an adaptive version of the particle marginal Metropilis-\/\+Hastings algorithm. The user is asked to design his/her own proposal density and prior distribution. The sampling is handled on an \char`\"{}as-\/is\char`\"{} basis, which means that it is entirely the user\textquotesingle{}s own responsibility to decide on what parameterization to use, to handle Jacobians if they are necessary, etc. These parameters will be written in an \char`\"{}as-\/is\char`\"{} fashion, as well. These calculations can be facilitates using the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{classparamPack}{param\+Pack}} class, however using this class is not absolutely necessary. Also, for convenience, a moving average covariance matrix estimate is performed; however, this should be ignored if the user is not interested in adaptive M\+C\+MC or isn\textquotesingle{}t using a transformed parameter space.
